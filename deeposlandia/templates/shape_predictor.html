<h4>Description</h4>

<p>In this dataset, there are three labels, and consequently the model aims at answering one question for each:
  <ul>
    <li>Is this a <b>square</b> on the picture?</li>
    <li>Is this a <b>circle</b> on the picture?</li>
    <li>Is this a <b>triangle</b> on the picture?</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Remark about model training</h4>

<p>The model used here has been trained during 10 epochs with a set of 18000 randomly generated images. It has been validated with a smaller set of 2000 randomly generated images (the validation occurred at the end of each training epoch), in order to ensure that learned features are as generic as possible.</p>

<h4>Use the deep learning model to predict image labels</h4>

<p>Click on the below button to generate a random picture with geometric shapes, and to display the corresponding label predictions, <em>i.e.</em> the probability that each shape is <em>really</em> on the picture according to the trained model.</p>
